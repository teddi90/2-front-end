                <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup
                    instructions, they've moved to <a href="#">their own section</a>. Continue reading for an
                    introduction

                <h2><sup>2</sup>Core Components</h2>
                <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and
                    the
                    app platform‚Äôs native capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs
                    APIs
                    as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of
                    reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover
                    how
                    components work in React Native.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="block">
                <h2><sup>3</sup>React Fundamentals</h2>
                <p>React Native runs on <a href="#">React</a>, a popular open source library for building user
                    interfaces
                    with JavaScript.
                    To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you
                    started
                    or can serve as a refresher course.</p>
                <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>+ components. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
                        approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
                    </li>
                    <li>+ JSX. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript
                        like
                        so: &lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;. The React docs have <a href="#">a
                            comprehensive
                            guide to JSX</a>
                        you can
                        refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you
                        are
                        declaring a name for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside &lt;Text&gt;.</li>
                    <li>+ props. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
                    </li>
                    <li>+ state. While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render,
                        state
                        is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over
                        time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="block">
                <h2><sup>4</sup>Handling Text Input</h2>
                <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop that
                    takes
                    a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a
                    function
                    to be called when the text is submitted.
                </p>
                <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                    language.
                    In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there
                    Bob"
                    would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
