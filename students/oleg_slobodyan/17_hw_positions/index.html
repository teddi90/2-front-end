                                        approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work
                                        in. </li>
                                    <li>+JSX. React and React Native use JSX,
                                        a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScrip t like so: &lt;
                                        Text&gt;
                                        Hello,
                                        I am your cat !&lt;/Text&gt;
                                        . The React docs have <a href="#">a comp rehensive guide to JSX</a>you
                                        can refer to learn
                                        even more. Because JSX is JavaScrip t,
                                        you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat,
                                        name,
                                        and embedding it with curly braces inside &lt;
                                        Text&gt;

                                        state is like a comp onent‚Äôs personal data storage. State
                                        is useful for handling data
                                        that

                                    and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called

                                    would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
