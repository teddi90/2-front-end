                        of
                        Berlin,
                        currently operated by Siesly and her sister Ashely. They needed help for a big rebrand and
                        wanted to
                        relaunch their website.</p>
                    <p class="text text_mr">
                        Their goals were simple, create a unique e-commerce store that bring a wonderful shopping

            <p class="text">Originally, the personality section of this persona was based off the Myers Briggs
                personality
                test. According to the Myers Briggs, there are 16 potential user personality types. Our template
                integrates
                questions from this online personality test example into a series of sliding bar graphics. If you’re
                confused as to what the sliders mean, check out the Myers Briggs basics article. </p>

            <p class="text">In the beginning, It’s just about brainstorming.</p>
            <p class="text">I list out a jumble of words and draw tiny sketches related to what I’m working on (and find
                the
                parallels later). Personally, I prefer paper with a grid so I can convey things responsively. Most of
                the
                time perfection isn’t an issue and the sketches are just for me.</p>

            <p class="text">I played with adding a wireframe of the website flow that would lead you in to each screen.
                For
                each of those screens I added a floating footer that allows users to see where they are in that
                particular
                flow and jump around as needed.” We’re digging this InVision-made wireframe.</p>
